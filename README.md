# Credit-Scoring-Task
This document analyzes the results of credit scoring for all wallets using a deep autoencoder-based approach. Each wallet was scored on a scale of 0â€“1000, where higher scores indicate behavior more similar to responsible, low-risk DeFi usage, and lower scores indicate potential risk or anomalies.
