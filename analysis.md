DeFi Wallet Credit Scoring Analysis
## Overview
This document analyzes the results of credit scoring for all wallets using a deep autoencoder-based approach. Each wallet was scored on a scale of 0–1000, where higher scores indicate behavior more similar to responsible, low-risk DeFi usage, and lower scores indicate potential risk or anomalies.

### Score Distribution
The bar chart below visualizes the number of wallets falling within each 100-point credit score range (e.g., 0–99, 100–199, …, 900–999):

Behavioral Insights
Wallets in the Lower Score Ranges (0–299)
Traits Observed:

High withdrawal-to-deposit ratios (frequent or large withdrawals relative to funds deposited).

Little or no evidence of regular deposits or repayments.

Occasional presence of liquidations, indicating unhealthy positions or credit events.

Irregular, bursty activity patterns, or long activity gaps.

Interpretation:
These wallets exhibited behaviors associated with elevated risk—such as draining balances, sporadic engagement, or adverse borrowing events. They may require additional scrutiny or stricter protocol controls.

Wallets in the Higher Score Ranges (700–999)
Traits Observed:

Consistent, repeated deposit actions over time.

Withdrawal behavior proportional and measured relative to deposits.

Few (or no) liquidations and timely repayments.

Stable or predictable transaction patterns, suggesting responsible use.

Interpretation:
High-scoring wallets align with “good user” profiles: active, responsible participants likely to fulfill protocol expectations and contribute positively to overall protocol health.
